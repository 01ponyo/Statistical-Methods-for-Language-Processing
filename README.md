# Statistical Methods for Language Processing

The following is a statistical project based on the learned information in the course “Statistical Methods for Language Processing”. The project is centered on Project Gutenberg, a free online library with over 70,000 downloadable books.

The following steps were implemented:

- Word and Bigram Counts: Extract and visualize word and bigram frequencies
- Bigram Analysis – “thinking of”: Compute the contingency matrix and chi-square test for the bigram “thinking of” and visualize results with a mosaic plot
- Entropy Computation: Calculate entropies for 1,000-word strings from the text
- Confidence Interval Calculation: Compute the 95% confidence interval for the entropies using the t-test
- Naive Bayes Classification: Apply a Naive Bayes classifier to determine the probability of sentence classification into four categories
